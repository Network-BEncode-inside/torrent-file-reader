torrent-file-reader
===================

Reads a torrent file into memory

This is a quick little project I wrote because I was curious about the
format of a torrent file.

It requires boost to build. It should build on any platform,
eventhough just a g++ Makefile is included.

Feel free to use in any way you wish.
